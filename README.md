I am a student currently enrolled in Compiler Theory (CMPILER) S12. 

# üíªSimple Parser
A parser should print ACCEPT, or REJECT + first offending token, for every input string in the text file.  This project is a simple parser program coded in Java.

# ‚úèRequirements
To be able to run this program, make sure that your device can run java (.java) programs and that you have updated versions of jdk and sdk. It is recommended that you run the program in a Java IDE as this was made as a project file in the IntelliJ IDE, however it is possible to run the program through the cmd terminal. 

### Input
To change the input that is fed to the program, go to recursive-descent-parser/src/input.txt of the project and edit the text document with your desired test case.

### Running the Program
1. Make sure that you have downloaded the complete copy of this repository on your device. 

2. Use an IDE to open the project (recommended IDE is IntelliJ - where this was originally coded). Alternatively, open your cmd terminal and go to the directory where the project is located.

3. Compile and Run the program through the IDE command (shortcut for IntelliJ is Shift+F10), or if you are using a cmd terminal, first compile the program by using the command: 'javac Parser.java', and afterwards run the program by using the command: 'java Parser'

4. You should be able to see the printed results in the output.txt found in the repository. 

### Entry Class File
The entry class file where the main function is located can be found under recursive-descent-parser/src/Main.java
Make sure that the input.txt file is also in the same location as the class entry file.
